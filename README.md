# redux-vanilla
this is to demo redux vanilla

## redux can work with vanilla js also 

## These are the steps for the redux app 

1) Get the handle to createStore from the redux
2) Write the reducer function 
3) Reducer will take state and action and will return the state
4) Execute the createStore and then pass in the reducer to get the store handle
5) Now run subscribe and dispatcher - dispacher will send the object with type inside it and subcribe will fire it'c call back
